title: Raspberry Flavoured - Vanilla Changes
hide_meta: true
---

In Raspberry Flavoured, some content from vanilla Minecraft has been changed and removed for balancing purposes.

## Villages

Villages, villagers, pillagers, and everything related to trading including emeralds has been removed.

### Cats

 Notably, this includes some naturally spawned cats. Cats can now be tamed either by finding a natural spawn in a Witch Hut, or by getting an Ocelot to trust you by feeding it fish, and then feeding it cat food to convert it into a cat.

## The Nether

## Leaving the Overworld

Accessing the Nether has been entirely changed. While a portal frame is still constructed of 10 Obsidian in the shape of a door, it must be lit with Dimensional Tears. Dimensional Tears can be obtained by using a Glass Bottle on Crying Obsidian, or by killing Witches.

Crying Obsidian can be found in the Overworld at ruined portals. These portals can either be discovered naturally, or be intentionally sought out by crafting Awoken Exopearls, which lead you to Ruined Portals.

## The End

The End has been entirely removed, with its content altered to fit new themes.

### Shulker Boxes

While Shulker Boxes do not exist in the current version of Raspberry Flavoured (stay tuned!), this is balanced out by bundles and Sacks, which can even be accessed in your inventory by scrolling.

### Endermen

Endermen have been rethemed to Exokin. Their mechanics have not changed, only their home. More will be revealed in future updates.
